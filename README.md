## Dataset overview

This dataset contains mobile app usage data, capturing key numerical attributes that provide insights into user behavior. Each record consists of the following attributes:
App: Name of the mobile application.
Usage (minutes): Total time spent on the app in minutes.
Notifications: Number of notifications received from the app.
Times Opened: Number of times the app was accessed.

This dataset is useful for mobile app engagement analysis due to the following characteristics:
Continuous Numerical Attributes: The dataset consists of numerical values, making it suitable for various analytical and machine learning models.
User Behavior Insights: The data can help identify patterns in app engagement, such as which apps users spend the most time on or receive the most notifications from.
Feature Engineering Potential: Additional features, such as average session duration or notification-to-open ratio, can be derived to enhance analysis.
Trend Analysis: The dataset can be used to track user habits and detect trends in mobile app usage over time.

In conclusion, this dataset serves as a valuable resource for analyzing mobile app usage patterns, providing insights into user interaction and engagement that can be leveraged for research or business decision-making.
